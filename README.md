### 2. Backend Setup (Server)

Follow these steps to set up the backend:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the `server` folder:

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2. Install all required dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file inside the `server/` folder and add the following environment variables to configure the database and server settings:

    ```env
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
    DB_NAME=parents_portal
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    PORT=5000
    ```

    Replace `your_mysql_password` and `your_jwt_secret` with your actual MySQL password and a secret key for JWT authentication.

4. Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

    This will run the backend server on port 5000 (or any port you configured in the `.env` file).

    Replace `root` with your MySQL username if it's different.
